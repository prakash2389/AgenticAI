LangGraph is specifically designed for complex work flows:

1) Branching Logic: Node(if not) -> Next Node(if not) -> Next Node -> Final response
2) FallBack Mechanism: If flow can't answers Users question, It will go to Human agent or next more about users query
3) Multi-Step Decision: In the Workflow, it will do multiple steps before answering question. 

State Managemnet is Key
