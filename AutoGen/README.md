AutoGen is an open-source framework that leverages multiple agents to enable complex workflows.

It is an open-source framework designed by Microsoft Research's AI Frontiers Lab to build AI agent systems. It simplifies the creation and orchestration of event-driven, distributed agentic applications, enabling multiple LLMs and SLM's, tools, and advanced multi-agent design patterns.


CrewAI excels at automating collaborative tasks and structured business processes, while AutoGen is better suited for complex, computation-heavy tasks that require fine-grained control over agent behaviors and interactions.
